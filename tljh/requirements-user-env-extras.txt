# When tljh.installer runs, the users' environment as typically found in
# /opt/tljh/user, is installed with these packages.
#
# Whats listed here represents additional packages that the distributions
# installs initially, but doesn't upgrade as tljh is upgraded.
#
# WARNING: The order of these dependencies matters, this was observed when using
#          the requirements-txt-fixer pre-commit hook that sorted them and made
#          our integration tests fail.
